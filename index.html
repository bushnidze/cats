            <p>The Unadulterated Cat is
            becoming an endangered species
            as more and more of us settle
            for those boring mass-produced
            cats the ad-men sell us - the
            pussies that purr into their
            gold-plated food bowls on the
            telly. But the Campaign for Real
            Cats sets out to change all that
            by helping us to recognise a
            true, unadulterated cat when we
            see one. For example: real cats
            have ears that look like they've
            been trimmed with pinking
            shears: real cats never wear flea
            collars...or appear on Christmas
            cards...or chase anything with a
            bell in it; real cats do eat
            quiche. And giblets. And butter.
            And anything else left on the
            table, if they think they can
            get away with it. Real cats can
            hear a fridge door opening two
            rooms away...
